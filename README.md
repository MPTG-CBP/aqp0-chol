All Relevant output data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files. 

Scripts to setup the MD simulations and to analyze the output data; topologies, and mdp simulation parameters are included in folders `scripts`, `top`, and `mdp`, respectively. 

GROMACS input TPR files can be downloaded [here]([xxx](https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/d/89bbb9565be84e7ba4fc/).  

MD trajectories and additional extensive metadata generated by the simulations (e.g. xvg files) are available from the corresponding author Camilo Aponte-Santamaría upon request.
